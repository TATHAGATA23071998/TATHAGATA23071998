## 1. 🏃‍♂️ Customer Fitness Application Analysis – Health & Engagement Optimization Project

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Repository-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white">
</a>

**Tools:** Python (Pandas) | SQL (SQL Server) | Tableau | ETL Pipeline Design

---

### 📌 Why This Project?

This project demonstrates the ability to handle complex **Data Engineering and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipelines before any visualization occurs.

Instead of starting with a clean dataset, the focus was on:
- Architecting a unified data model from messy, multi-grain sources
- Preventing Cartesian explosions and data duplication
- Building a scalable **Master Fact Table** optimized for BI reporting

---

### 🎯 Business Problem

The raw customer health and activity data was fragmented across **18 separate files** tracking events on completely different timelines (e.g., daily weight logs, hourly steps, and second-by-second heart rates).

The main challenges were:
- Directly joining these tables in SQL would cause massive data duplication
- Null values and missing inputs threatened to break mathematical averages (e.g., a "0" for heart rate ruins physiological trendlines)
- The business lacked a single "Source of Truth" to answer core operational questions

Because of this, it was impossible to track intraday behaviors or correlate health domains (like sleep vs. activity).

The business needed:
- A single, blank-free Master Fact Table
- Clear visibility into peak engagement hours
- Reliable segmentation of workout intensity (casual walking vs. intense cardio)
- Insights into how recovery (sleep) impacts physical exertion

---

### 🛠 My Approach

#### 1️⃣ Data Selection & Deduplication
- Audited 18 raw datasets and scaled down to the **11 most relevant files**
- Dropped pre-aggregated files to prevent redundancy
- Excluded overly noisy minute-level sleep logs to focus strictly on executive-level KPIs

#### 2️⃣ Engineered a Python ETL Pipeline
- **Granularity Alignment:** Aggregated second-level heart rate and minute-level METs into standardized hourly averages
- **Collision Prevention:** Renamed overlapping columns (e.g., `Calories` to `HourlyCalories` and `DailyCalories`)
- **The Master Join:** Executed a `FULL OUTER JOIN` on the hourly timeline, followed by a `LEFT JOIN` for daily metrics
- **Smart Imputation:** Handled missing activity with `0`, and imputed missing heart rates using the user's *personal historical average* to protect mathematical integrity

#### 3️⃣ Database Integration (SQL Server)
Created a rigid database schema to bypass SSMS import errors caused by messy data:
- Mapped IDs to `BIGINT`
- Forced timestamps to `DATETIME` (avoiding the binary timestamp trap)
- Set activity metrics to `FLOAT` for seamless decimal conversions

#### 4️⃣ Performed Business-Focused Analysis
**Engagement Insights**
- Peak intraday engagement hours
- Weekly activity trends (Weekend vs. Mid-week)
- Total active users and daily average steps

**Exertion Insights**
- Distance segmented by intensity (Very Active vs. Lightly Active)
- Caloric burn correlated with total distance
- Top 10 "Super Users" by total steps

**Health & Recovery Insights**
- Average resting and peak heart rates
- Sleep efficiency (Time in Bed vs. Time Asleep)
- Impact of sleep duration on next-day activity levels

### 📊 Tableau Executive Dashboard -

</a>

Built a 3-tier interactive Tableau dashboard to translate the Fact Table into visual insights.

**Dashboard Highlights:**
- Top Row: Macro KPIs (Total Users, Avg Steps, Avg Calories, Avg Sleep Duration)
- Middle Row: Behavioral Cadence (Area charts mapping peak hours and weekly step trends)
- Bottom Row: Exertion Quality (Stacked bar charts separating casual walking from intense cardiovascular distance)
- Super User Leaderboard

---

### 📈 Key Outcomes
- Built a clean, blank-free hourly Master Fact Table from 11 disjointed sources
- Eliminated data collisions and Cartesian explosions
- Identified a massive volume spike in user activity between 4:00 PM and 8:00 PM
- Discovered a mid-week engagement slump (Wednesday–Friday)
- Proved that the vast majority of user distance is "Lightly Active" (sedentary/casual walking)

## 2. 🚖 Ride-Hailing Operations Intelligence – Reducing Booking Failures & Revenue Leakage  
<a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tathagata.chakraborty5102/viz/OLADashboard/Dashboard">
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Repository-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white">
</a>

**Tools Used:** Python | SQL | Streamlit | Data Visualization  

---

## 📌 Project Context

This project analyzes end-to-end booking data from a ride-hailing platform to understand:

- Why bookings fail  
- Where revenue is leaking  
- How driver behavior impacts performance  
- How payment method affects ride completion  

The focus was operational efficiency and revenue realization — not just dashboard creation.

---

## 🎯 Core Business Problem

Although demand was stable, nearly **38% of bookings were not converting into completed rides**.

This indicated:

- Revenue leakage  
- Operational inefficiencies  
- Driver accountability gaps  
- Customer dissatisfaction  

The business needed a consolidated view of:

- Booking success vs failure  
- Cancellation drivers  
- Vehicle-wise performance  
- Payment reliability  
- Rating mismatches  

---

## 🛠 Analytical Approach

### 1️⃣ Demand & Volume Analysis

- Daily rides remained stable (~42K–46K per day)
- No major spikes or drops
- Slight increase at month-end

**Insight:** Demand is consistent. The issue is not customer demand — it is operational execution.

---

### 2️⃣ Booking Outcome Analysis

Booking distribution:

- 62.06% Completed
- 17.90% Driver Cancelled
- 10.20% Customer Cancelled
- 9.85% Driver Not Found

**Key Finding:**  
Driver-side issues (cancellations + not found ≈ 28%) dominate ride failures.

Revenue loss is primarily supply-driven, not demand-driven.

---

### 3️⃣ Cancellation Root Cause

**Customer Cancellations:**
- Main reason: Driver not moving toward pickup (largest volume)
- Minor reasons: change of plans, AC issues, wrong address

**Driver Cancellations:**
- Mostly due to personal or vehicle-related issues
- Very low customer-related cancellation triggers

**Conclusion:**  
Operational discipline and driver readiness are major improvement areas.

---

### 4️⃣ Vehicle Performance Analysis

- Premium vehicles (Prime categories) complete longer trips
- Auto and Bike show shorter distances
- Incomplete rides are mostly short-distance trips
- Premium segments show slightly better rating alignment

**Insight:** Higher incentives improve completion rates.

---

### 5️⃣ Payment Method Analysis

- Cash generates high booking value but high cancellations
- UPI shows high value with better completion rates
- Cards contribute minimal share

**Business Interpretation:**  
Digital payments are more reliable. Cash rides increase operational risk.

---

### 6️⃣ Rating & Experience Alignment

- Average ratings are around 4.0 across vehicles
- Rating gaps observed in some categories
- Negative gap = Customer dissatisfaction
- Positive gap = Driver dissatisfaction

Service quality is stable, but perception gaps indicate training opportunities.

### 1. 🏃‍♂️ Health & Product Analytics: User Engagement Optimization

**Tools:** Python (Pandas) | SQL (SQL Server) | Tableau | ETL Pipeline Design

* 🎯 **Core Metrics Tracked:** Peak Engagement Hours, Average Daily Caloric Burn, Step Volume, Sleep Efficiency.

* 📌 **The Business Decision:** The product and marketing teams needed to optimize push notification timing but lacked a "Source of Truth" due to highly fragmented user data spread across 18 separate files tracking events on different timelines.

* 🛠 **Technical Execution & ETL:**
  * Consolidated 11 distinct raw datasets into a highly optimized Master Fact Table at the daily grain.
  * Aggregated highly granular second-by-second heart rate and minute-by-minute METs into standardized hourly averages.
  * Executed a `FULL OUTER JOIN` on the hourly timeline to prevent data loss, followed by a `LEFT JOIN` for daily metrics.
  * Handled missing activity with `0` and intelligently imputed missing heart rates using the user's personal historical average to protect mathematical integrity.

* 📊 **Stakeholder Delivery & Outcomes:** 
  * Built a 3-tier interactive Tableau dashboard tracking behavioral cadence.
  * Discovered the average user records **~7,765 steps** and burns **~2,339 calories** daily.
  * Identified that engagement volume spikes heavily in the late afternoon and early evening (**16:00 - 20:00**).
  * Discovered a mid-week engagement slump (Wednesday–Friday)
  * The vast majority of users are "Lightly Active" (sedentary/casual walking)


* 💡 **Strategic Recommendations:**
  * Target engagement bursts at peak hours (16:00-20:00) with short, contextual nudges.
  * Schedule social challenges on weekends to maximize baseline participation, retention, and viral spread.
  * Create features or premium offerings targeted for the premium customers (e.g., leaderboards, advanced metrics).

### 2. 🚖 Supply Chain & Operations: Ride-Hailing Bottleneck Analysis

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Repository-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white">
</a>

**Tools Used:** Python | SQL | Streamlit | Data Visualization  

* 🎯 **Core Metrics Tracked:** Booking Conversion Rate, Revenue Leakage, Driver Cancellation Rate, Turnaround Time.

* 📌**The Business Decision:** Despite stable platform demand (~42K–46K rides/day), regional operations required a consolidated view to pinpoint bottlenecks, revenue drivers, and service quality gaps causing poor ride completion rates.

* 🛠 **Technical Execution:**
  * Evaluated end-to-end operations at the individual booking level using Python and SQL to explicitly identify cancellation drivers.
  * Segmented payment methods to mathematically correlate transaction types with operational reliability.
  * Visualized outputs in an interactive Streamlit application to enable real-time operational monitoring for branch managers.

* 📊 **Stakeholder Delivery & Outcomes:**
  * Identified massive revenue leakage: nearly **38%** of bookings do not convert into completed rides.
  * Found huge supply-side issue; the vast majority of customer cancellations (84,474 cases) occur because drivers do not move toward the pickup location.
  * Found that **Cash** payments generate high booking value but incur the highest operational risk, while **UPI** emerges as the most reliable payment method.

* 💡 **Strategic Recommendations:**
  * Introduce stricter penalties for frequent driver cancellations and improve real-time movement tracking.
  * Aggressively encourage UPI and digital payments to directly improve overall platform completion rates.
  * Demand is stable and operational control causes the bottleneck.

### 3. 🎮 Market & Strategy Analytics: Product Profitability & ROI (Global Game Sales)

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Project_Repository-181717?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white">
</a>

**Tools:** Python (Pandas) | SQL | Tableau | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* 🎯 **Core Metrics Tracked:** Global Sales Volume, Regional Market Share, Average Product Rating, Wishlist Velocity.

* 📌 **The Business Decision:** Marketing and development executives needed to identify top-tier revenue drivers and evaluate platform profitability to strategically guide future resource allocation and localized ad spend.

* 🛠 **Technical Execution:**
  * Processed disjointed product and sales datasets using Python to address missing values, handle data type inconsistencies, and correct structural errors.
  * Executed `INNER JOIN` logic in SQL to successfully unify game attributes with global sales performance and user engagement metrics.

* 📊 **Stakeholder Delivery & Outcomes:**
  * Engineered a dynamic Tableau dashboard facilitating exploratory market analysis.
  * Discovered the **Action ($661.65M)** and **Shooter ($400.68M)** genres are the primary global revenue drivers.
  * Identified the 'Sweet Spot': Titles rated between **3.5 and 4.0** generate the highest overall sales at **$1,058M**.

* 💡 **Strategic Recommendations:**
  * Implement a development **'Quality Gate'** to delay titles projected to score below 3.5, avoiding the steep revenue drop-offs observed with lower-rated games.
  * Avoid head-to-head competition with Nintendo's massive **46.30%** market share in the family-friendly niche by strategically pivoting to the Shooter genre.
  * Utilize pre-launch **'Wishlist Velocity'** as a leading indicator to accurately forecast demand and adjust physical copy production volumes.
